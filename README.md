# WordPress Self-Service

WordPress plugin and SaltStack config to allow users to create and manage their own dedicated WordPress instances. 

The idea is that you set up a WordPress instance with this plugin on the Salt master, and it provides a non-developer user interface for people to create and manage their own WordPress instances.

The idea is that instances will be based on admin-managed templates, e.g. specifying combinations of plugins to use, in order to specialise the site for particular purposes.

Use vagrant to build/run the `vagrant-dev` VM to develop/play.

Work in progress...
